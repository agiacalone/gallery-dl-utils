utilities for downloading comics from various comic book sites

Various utilities that I've made to automate the downloading process of comics on my Linux server. As of right now, the code is not well documented and is pretty hacky. I'll be improving this as time goes on and as my own needs come up. Pull requests welcome!

The files here require the use of gallery-dl and have been tested on Ubuntu Linux and macOS. It should work on most standard *NIX operating systems as far as I am aware.
